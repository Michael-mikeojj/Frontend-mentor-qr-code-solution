## My process

At first I wrote down everything I needed and how it was going to be arranged which was my text, the image and the white background so I created my code structure first on a book then put all the details. After that I used an external CSS file to style it to fit the design. The place I used help was on sizing the image and changing the font-family but I got some help by reading other people's code on frontend mentor.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learnt a lot because this is my first actual project I am glad I could put to work the html and css I learned. I also learnt how to change font-families on css it had been giving me issues for a while on how to do it so I read others people code on front-end mentor and saw how they did it and learnt from it. Also I learnt to work with images sizing it and fitting it to scale

code snippet for changing font-family:

```css
.text {
  font-family: "outfit", sans-serif;
}

img {
  width: 100%;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I want to pick up more on html and css and eventually add some Java script to it but I am ready to start learning and improving God help me
